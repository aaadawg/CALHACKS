Welcome to CheckersSquared! 

You are probably wondering why you are here? We are also wondering the same thing.
Well, now that we have you, We want to play a game... ;)
In this game you will be be pitted against 3 other challengers in a battle of wits, skill, and strategy.
The rules are simple... kinda:

You are playing a game similar to checkers. There are two kinds of pieces king, and non-king. A non-king piece can move and capture forward, left, right and backward. Each player will start with 8 non-king pieces. A piece gets kinged by moving to the opposite end of the board. A king piece can move in every way a non-king piece can and can also move and capture diagonally. Every player starts with a bank of points. You gain points by capturing pieces and you can spend points to allow non-king pieces to move backwards. These points will also determine the winner in the case of a stalemate which results from 30 consecutive moves with no captures. Thats about it! Feel free to smack talk your oppenents, the more the better!
